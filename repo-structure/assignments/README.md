# Class assignment org

* All assignments are to be posted here
* Forked by students
* Submitted with a PR

* README.md contains the actual assignment
* Should be a test folder and scaffolding if it's a challenge
* solution folder should be there (or linked) to help TAs be consistent
* Best way to deal with whiteboard photos or repls?
