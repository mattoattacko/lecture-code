# 'lib' folder
* One folder for each DS/A
* Teach from here
* Readme has the notes, images, links, etc
* Full implementation ...
    - package.json (student could install as a module)
    - tests
    
# 'challenges' folder
* One folder for each DS/A
* Each DS/A can have multiple challenges in it
* README.md for the challenge is the prompt
* test.js is the test suite the students should run their code against
* solution folder is for the official solution (so that we have something to grade against and break down)


# Questions --
* How do we spoonfeed these to the students?
* Do we put the challenges in EdRepublic instead of here?
* If a challenge assumes an implementation from the "lib" folder, do we give that to them for free (link it in somehow)?
* Can we use the "assignments" folder/org to have the students sumbit their work all in one place?
