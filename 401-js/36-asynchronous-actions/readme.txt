Introduce the concept of MOCK REST Apis ... here, we use a simple one called "json-server" to talk about how to quickly setup a REST api to write front end code against.

Talk through online options and swagger -- mockable.io

Also, introduce a more generic express/mongo based API that introduces the concept of a generic API allowing you to use a dynamic model

-- Should load the model dynamicallyl instead of brute-force pulling in the whole directory.

Use this to explain that concept to the students, and how you can extract model (business) logic from the routes and leave them to do what they are meant to, which is to route and respond, not operate.
