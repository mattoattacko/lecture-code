# Functional Programming
The `fp` module implements `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and `slice` manually.

Run the tests with `npm test`.

Why does the original lab have us simply wrapping array methods with `call` and
`apply`? It seems like a shame to not teach students how to implement these
functions themselves.

Seems like there could be a better way to teach `call` and `apply`.
