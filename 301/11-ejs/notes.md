## How the Web "Really" Works

##Server Side Rendering
  - Google and other crawlers
  - SEO
  - Quicker read time
  - No "FOUC"
  - Most of the internet works this way.
  
##Client Side Rendering
  - Generally better for SPAs and Mobile Apps
  - Great for internal tooling
  - Great for dynamic pages (like shopping carts)
  - Good for getting additional information from server
