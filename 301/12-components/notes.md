## "If it hurts, don't do it"

### Dan Abramov (React)

Modularity
- Stress the importance of not repeating  yourself
- Find pain (doing the same thing x times) and removing that pain

Demo Code
- move the head, header, footer into separate views
- pull them in as partials
- re-organize the views folder with pages and partials directories
- Add a 2nd route tied to the first one 
  - click a category, see the links for it.
