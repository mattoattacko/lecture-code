# Concepts

Normally, during class, we riff around and break off the lecture to teach various JS concepts that we might be using in our class code but not necessarily the focal point of the day.

* spread
* object deconstruction
* etc

Often, these gems get buried in the lecture folders and we all forget where that stuff is if a student wants to re-reference it.

This would give us a place to put these, either as seprate files or folders with a README.md

It should be on the instructor to create these files and folders on the fly as they come up

## NOTE
If we go down the road of teaching some of these concepts as either "lightning talks" or as mini-lectures on the weekends, then these folders become the source of those lectures and must have a README and more information for context for the students
