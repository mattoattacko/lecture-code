# Library Modules we create in class
* express middleware
* promisify
* composers
* etc

The idea here is that the students have a cool "takeaway" not unlile underscore, but made up of things that we riffed on and used as part of class.

It would be cool to keep adding things to this file/folder as we go, and then require them as we build stuff so that they can see the process.

Some would be in a single lib file, and others independent modules
