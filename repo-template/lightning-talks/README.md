# Lightning Talks
30 minute mini-lectures designed to introduce a concept or familiarize the students with things relevant to their future jobs or the industry in general.

These would carry some recommended reading/resources and even some sample code, but no assignments.

Ideally, each student and the TAs could research and deliver one, and the instructor would deliver the rest.
