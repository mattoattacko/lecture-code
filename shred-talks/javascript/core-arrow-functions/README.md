# Javascript Arrow Functions

Shorthand for regular functions.

```let functionName = (params) => returnValue;```

Simply put, it's a function that takes params (in the parens) and returns a value (whatever is after the =>)
    
- the () are optional if there's only one param
- If you have to process information, you must use a ```{}``` after the ```=>``` and return a value.
