# Javascript Strings

## Basics
  
**Strings are objects**

```let name="John"```

This creates a more primitive string. You get all of the "goodness" of a proper string object (below) but you don't have to create it that way and manage it. ths just makes it easy for you to jump in and do your work


```let name = new String("John");```

This creates a "proper" JS object with obvious access to it's properties and methods.  Do this in your console. and log it out directly and you can browse it.


In either case, you can manipulate strings in some interesting ways.
