## Overview
#### Tree 
A tree is an Abstract Data Type (ADT) where each node has as many children as it likes. In a tree there may not be any loops, where children are able to reference an ancestor. 
* The top node of a tree is called the root.
* Connections between nodes are called edges. 
* Nodes without children are called Leafs.  
* The depth of a tree is the maximum number of edges from the root to a leaf.

###### K-ary tree
a k-ary tree is a tree where each node has no more than K-children
* a complete k-ary tree is a tree where every depth level is filled out completely, before the next level can recieve any nodes
* a perfert k-ary tree is a tree where all leaf nodes are the same depth

###### Binary Tree
a 2-ary tree is often called a binary tree.
