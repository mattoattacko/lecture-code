# Bus Mall Implementation

NOTES:

- Used some sorting (maybe to advanced for a 201?)


QUESTIONS:
- When do we start talking about factoring things out?
- When do we start introducing conventions like never modifying object properties directly (but using methods instead)?
- Can we introduce the usage of objects (like I did here) or even sets to track things you've seen?
-- Or, is it more about having the class learn how to torture arrays so that they have comfort?
